## Like exclusive fullscreen but without all performance issues related to exclusive fullscreen mode!

- If you have a 1080p monitor, it's ready to go! Just follow up instruction inside .bat file.
- - If its a 900p ajust .bat for your need.
- You don't need big knowledge on programming to edit .bat file. Notepad it's all you need.
- - You are using GitHub, so... I really think you know what are you doing hehe
 
- I didn't tested on Steam, Epic, GoG Games; Can run but I don't know (ツ)_/¯
- DON'T USE FOR ONLINE GAMING. Some voices on my head say it's fine but others "That wizardry can ban". Just for off-line games OKAY????
